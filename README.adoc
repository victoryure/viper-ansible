== Overview


Good Ansible is a "better" version of the repo `bad-ansible` for training
 purposes. In time, perhaps, it will become good - for now think "better" Ansible

. Env Files and Settings

Inventory file hosts, ssh.cfg reflect a particular lab environment and will need
 modified to be used elsewhere.

=== ssh.cfg

This, optional, configuration file assumes the use of a `bastion` or `jumpbox`
and in some environments will be unnecessary or alternatively the `~/.ssh/config`
 or equivalent should be used.

`ansible.cfg` references `ssh.cfg` so this may need to be removed or commented
 out
